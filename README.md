# PaperTrail

### Keep track of your model's changes

Shamelessly ripping off the name from the [Ruby Library](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/)

## Installation

Include `backbone.papertrail.js` in your HTML head

    <script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/backbone.papertrail.js"></script>

Or in your Rails 3.1.x or 3.2.x Asset Pipeline

    //= require backbone.papertrail
